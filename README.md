# Ip Scanner :zap:
Ip Scanner scans for metadata about any given IP Address. 

The main reason for this project was to help gather intelligence about IPs. 
It can be helpful in many cases such as OCINT, Red Teaming/Blue Teaming, CTF events or just causal 
information about ip addresses.


# Roadmap :round_pushpin:
